    <h4>Steps To Make This</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li><p>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan.</p> <p>Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir),</p> <p>turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - </p> <p>then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</p></li>
        <li><p>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</p> <p>Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</p></li>
