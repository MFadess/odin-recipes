    <h4>What Is It?</h4>
        <p>So what makes Korean fried chicken so different from it's American counterpart? While its American cousin is usually 
            brined and dredged in a flour and buttermilk mixture,</p> 
        <p>Korean fried chicken tends to be more light and crispier with a thin, 
           almost paper like skin that is not heavily battered. </p>
